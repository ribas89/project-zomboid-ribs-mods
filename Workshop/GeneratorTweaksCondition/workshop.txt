description=- Catastrophic Failure: Configure thresholds and probabilities for fire or explosion when condition is critical.
description=- FIX GENERATOR NOCAP: Adds a new repair option that lets you fix generators beyond the vanilla limit and even while they are running.
description=- Allowed Repair Items: Choose which items can be used with FIX GENERATOR NOCAP for flexible repair options.
description=- Max Condition: Set the maximum possible condition value for generators.
