# Project Zomboid – RIBS Mods

This repository is a **mirror** of several *Project Zomboid* mods already published on **Steam Workshop**.
It includes **only the files provided by those mods**, exactly as they appear in the Steam Workshop release, including any modified game files if present in the original mod.
No unmodified base game code or third-party assets are included.

## Installation

1. Copy any mod folder into your `Zomboid/mods` directory:
   - **Windows:** `%UserProfile%\Zomboid\mods`
   - **Linux/macOS:** `~/.Zomboid/mods`
2. Enable the mods in the Project Zomboid **Mods** menu.
3. Restart the game if prompted.

## Notes

* Files here are provided **as-is** for convenience, backup, and development reference.
* Some mods may include modified `.class` files from the game, but only as released on **Steam Workshop**.
* If a mod includes a `workshopID`, you can find the original Workshop page using that ID.
